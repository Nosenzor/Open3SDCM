# Open3SDCM
An attempt to read unencrypted 3Shape DCM

## Goals of the project :

1/ Read an extract the mesh(es) geometrical information (vertices coordinates and triangles) from DCM
2/ Convert to STL, PLY, OBJ
3/ Read colors applied on meshes
4/ Read UV mapping and Texture

# Not part of the goals (at least at the beginning)
* Write DCMs
* Read encrypted file
